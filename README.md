# 🔊 Text to Speech Converter

This is a simple and visually appealing **Text to Speech Converter** web application. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this app allows users to enter any text, choose from available voices, and convert it to speech using the browser's **Web Speech API**.

## 📌 Features

* 🗣️ Convert typed text into speech
* 🎤 Choose from a list of available voices
* 🖼️ Beautiful gradient UI design
* 🖱️ One-click to speak the content
* 💡 Uses the browser’s built-in `SpeechSynthesis` API
* 🔄 Fully responsive layout

## 📂 Project Structure

```

│
├── index.html        # Main HTML file with structure and elements
├── styles.css        # Custom styling with gradients and layout
├── scripts.js        # Core logic for voice selection and speech

```

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. `index.html`

* Contains the main app structure.
* Includes a `textarea` for text input, a `select` dropdown for voice selection, and a `button` to trigger speech.

### 2. `styles.css`

* Applies a vibrant, colorful background using CSS gradients.
* Styles the layout responsively for good user experience.
* Customizes the button and dropdown elements.

### 3. `scripts.js`

* Fetches and populates the list of available voices using `speechSynthesis.getVoices()`.
* Allows dynamic voice selection via `<select>`.
* On clicking the "Listen" button, reads the text from the `textarea` using the chosen voice.
